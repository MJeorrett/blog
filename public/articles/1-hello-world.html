<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Matthew and this is my blog called <b>Nine Bits in a Byte</b> (I'll explain why in a future article).</p>

<p>I am Developer Evangelist at <a href='https://wallet.services'>Wallet.Services</a> where I mostly write C# and typescript. We are developing a blockchain-as-a-service platform so I get to play with blockchains sometimes which is <b>awesome!</b></p>

<p>I have started this blog as a channel for exploring different things from my day to day work.  Most of what I am paid for is coding in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language'>high level languages</a> and so here I want to explore lower level stuff; I want to get <b>close to the metal</b>!</p>

<p>This page is quite basic (as you may have noticed!).  I have started with a really simple a setup: a <a href='https://nodejs.org/en/'>node</a> back end running an <a href='https://expressjs.com/'>express</a> server and no framework or templating. My plan is to build up this site and get back to the basics of front end development with the aim of getting a deeper understanding of what is going on.<p>

<p>I'm going to find a way to directly link the source code of this site with the content so that this blog is about the development of the blog: <b>inception!</b>.  While I head off to see if I can get this inception idea rolling I'll leave you with a picture; my marketing colleague <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQqGVT3Lip_IYMvg6syADDw'>Blockchain Beyonce</a> told me that blogs with pictures get more readers...</p>
